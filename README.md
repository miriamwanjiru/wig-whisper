I decided to design the wig website with a modern, clean, and feminine aesthetic that reflects both elegance and confidence, which are qualities many wig wearers seek. The theme centers on empowerment — which is why I chose the slogan “Own Your Crown” in the hero section. I used pink shades to give it a soft and glamorous look, aligning with the beauty industry.

The layout follows a landing page structure to quickly capture attention and guide users to action. The navigation bar allows smooth access to each section (Home, Products, Shop, About, Contact, FAQs), while the hero section immediately introduces the brand and invites visitors to explore. The product cards highlight key wig types in a visually clear and engaging way using Bootstrap for responsiveness.

I also made sure the design was mobile-friendly using media queries, so the page is accessible on different devices. Using Bootstrap helped speed up styling and ensure consistency in spacing, layout, and responsiveness.
